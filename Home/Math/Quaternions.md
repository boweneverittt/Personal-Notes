#### Review
[[Rigid Body Kinematics]]

#### Formula:
a + bi + cj + dk* * *

#### Unit Quat:
Uq = q/||q||

#### Quick Notes:
- axis angle representation of the gyros is the first order derivative of the orientation
- quaternion is describing some rotation between where you're orientated, and where you where when you began (for orientation using gyros only) or from North East South West and up and down (if doing absolute orientation with mags and accs)
- axis angle representation is just a quaternion that represents the rotation that your gyros are measuring
- all unit quaternions are are axis angle with the axis being normalized

*euler angles is rotation in deg around x y z
axis angle is rotation w around vector x y z*
